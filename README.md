# Flight Delay Analysis

##   Overview

My Objective is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on a flight Experience Dataset, to find insights with delayed flights, lookout for patterns common to them and identity possible causes of flight delays. I made use of the Best Available Tools and Resources to Explore and present insights using Data Visualization.

##  Tools


*  Excel

*  Power BI

*  Adobe illustrator




##  Resources

* Flight Data source : 
<https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/blob/main/Airline%20Project/Airlines.csv>

*  ###  Overlayed Data : 
*  Airport Names: 
<https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes>
*  Airline Names :

##  Where is the Data? 
The Data used for my Analysis were from 3 Different sources (see Resources), the main flight data has Airport and Airline codes as a means of identity, hence the need to source for external Data set that would  overlay these codes and provide the names of Airlines, Airport and their location, by creating a Data model  between the 3 tables.
