# Flight Delay Analysis

##   Overview
As a Capstone project for Microsoft Organized NG30DaysofLearning Training. It's required that I apply the Analytical skills I learnt during the course of the training, to tell a story about Flight Delay Experiences. 
My Objective is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on a flight Experience Dataset, to find insights with delayed flights, lookout for patterns common to them and identity possible causes of flight delays. I made use of the Best Available Tools and Resources to Explore and present insights using Data Visualization.

##  Tools


*  Microsoft Excel - For Creating custom tables, since some of the External Datasets were neither in CSV nor JSON format, before importing the Data into Power BI. Though I can still do this on Power BI, but Microsoft Excel gives me more flexibility.

*  Microsoft Power BI - The Primary tool I used for my Analysis and report building. It contains a vast library of tools for Visualization.

*  Adobe illustrator - I used illustrator as a supporting tool for design. I Used Adobe illustrator in Designing icons and wireframes that I built my report with. 




##  Resources

* Flight Data source :

*  ####  Overlayed Data : 
*  Airport Names:

*  Airline Names :

##  Where is the Data? 
The Data used for my Analysis were from 3 Different sources (see **Resources**), the main flight data has Airport and Airline codes as a means of identity, hence the need to source for external Data set that would  overlay these codes and provide the names of Airlines, Airport and their location, by creating a Data model  between the 3 tables.

1. __Data Cleaning :__ The Flight Data is a cleaned up Dataset, hence required no further cleaning, except some necessary transformations. On the other hand, the overlayed Data needed some cleaning and transformation to remove unneeded columns from the Table. 
2. __Defining the Context and Objectives:__ Before starting any Analysis, I like to gain clarity from the start. And I achieve this by defining the context of Who my audience is, What is required of me, Why It's important to them and How I can meet this requirements. 
3. __Data Overlay and and Reverse Geocoding :__
